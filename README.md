This repository includes files that I coded for my practice.

1. PatternTest.java: It contains Basic patterns such as a half pyramid and a hollow rectangle.
2. AdvancePatternTest.java: This code prints some advanced patterns for beginners using for loop. This file contains- a. Bow tie (Butterfly) b. Rhombus c. Pyramid d. Palindrome.
3. FibonacciSeries.java: I have seen some tutorials regarding this series and found they usually print the first two digits manually and start the loop with 3rd digit. I find this unnecessary and here is an improved version of it.
4. Gcd.java: Find the Greatest Common Divisor among two numbers.
5. SearchInput.java: Code to input values in an array of a given length and look for an index of a given value.
6. SearchTwoDArray: Create a two-dimensional Array by taking input from the user, assigning value taken from the user, and finding the index of a specific value. Additional code commented for printing the 2D array in a matrix and printing mathematical coordinates instead of index.
